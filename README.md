# CPPFileUtils
I created this library for my own convinience, to ease the use of file/folder creation, manipulation, analysis, discovery ect.
Relies on the std::filesystem available since C++17. 

## Usage
Just download FileUtils.h and #include it into your project. All functions are explained in the comments.

## Test
Open the project in Visual Studio, create a folder in C\: called "FileUtilTest" and start Debugging, this runs the test suite.
